The inventory screen is used to enter a complete periodic inventory of the food stocked in the restaurant. The date and time of the inventory is recorded automatically by the program. The table displays from left to right the name of each food item, the quantity of the item currently in stock and the unit of measure for that item. Except in demo mode, the table starts out empty and the program user must enter the full inventory. (In demo mode, the table starts with a set of entries in order to save the user's time. Instead of entering everything from scratch, the user can just edit the table.)

To add a food item to the table, select the item from one of the drop down boxes directly below the table. (Note that the current prototype program only supports the "other" category for food items. In production versions of the program with restaurants stocking upwards of 150 items, all five categories will be active.) Type the quantity in the quantity field on the line below the drop boxes. The program automatically shows the correct unit of measure. Click the add button.

In order to delete an inventory entry, click the item to highlight it and then click the delete button.

When finished editing, the user has two choices. Clicking on the finished-save-inventory-on-exit button marks the inventory as complete and ready for recording on disk. The inventory can no longer be modified. Clicking on the finished-do-not-save-on-exit button indicates that the inventory is not complete. In this state, it will not be recorded to the disk when the program exits. However, so long as the program is not exited, the user can return to the inventory screen, make additional edits and then click on the finished-save-inventory-on-exit button in order to lock the inventory for writing to the disk. (In demo mode, nothing is ever written to the disk, so there is only one button for departing from the inventory screen.)
